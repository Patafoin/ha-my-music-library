---

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.1 or later
- [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/) integration installed and configured

---

## Installation

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/my_music_library/` folder into `/config/custom_components/` on your Home Assistant instance.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **My Music Library**.
4. Follow the setup flow (select your Music Assistant server URL and default player).

### HACS (custom repository)

1. In HACS, go to **Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/Patafoin/ha-my-music-library` with category **Integration**.
3. Install **My Music Library** from HACS.
4. Restart Home Assistant and add the integration via the UI.

> The Lovelace card resource (`/my_music_library/my-music-library-card.js`) is registered automatically — no manual resource addition required.

---

## Integration Options

After installation, you can configure additional options via **Settings → Devices & Services → My Music Library → Configure**.

### Hidden players

Select one or more media player entities to hide from the device picker inside the card. This is useful to exclude virtual players, browser tabs, or any device you do not want to see in the list.

You can also type a **wildcard pattern** (e.g. `media_player.browser_mod_*`) and press **Enter** to exclude all matching players at once.

The card re-fetches this list every time it is reloaded or the user navigates back to the dashboard, so changes take effect without a full page refresh.

---

## Adding the Card to a Dashboard

In your dashboard, add a **Custom: My Music Library Card** card, or use the YAML editor:

```yaml
type: custom:my-music-library-card
```

---

## Card Configuration (YAML)

All options are optional.

```yaml
type: custom:my-music-library-card

# Default tab shown when the card loads.
# Options: player | search | library
default_tab: player

# Fixed card height. Accepts pixels (number or "600px") or any valid CSS value.
# When omitted the card fills 100 % of the space allocated by the dashboard layout.
height: 600

# Pre-select a specific media_player entity as the default player.
# The user can still change it at runtime; their choice is saved in localStorage.
entity: media_player.my_speaker

# Custom buttons on the LEFT side of the tab bar
nav_buttons_left:
  - icon: mdi:home
    name: Home          # tooltip / label (optional)
    tap_action:
      action: navigate
      navigation_path: /

# Custom buttons on the RIGHT side of the tab bar
nav_buttons_right:
  - icon: mdi:television-play
    name: TV
    entity: media_player.tv   # optional — button highlights when entity state is "on/playing/active"
    tap_action:
      action: toggle
    hold_action:
      action: more-info
```

## Custom Tab-Bar Buttons (`nav_buttons_left` / `nav_buttons_right`)

| `height` | `number \| string` | Button height override. |
| `tap_action` | `Action` | Action fired on a single click. |
| `hold_action` | `Action` | Action fired after holding the button for 500 ms. |

### Action object

```yaml
action: <action_type>
# ... action-specific fields
```

| `action` | Description | Extra fields |

## Changelog

### 2.8.9
- **Fix** — library source filter (Local / Streaming) now works correctly; provider mappings (`set` type) are properly serialized from Music Assistant.
- **Improvement** — library sections render progressively as each section loads, instead of waiting for all sections to complete.
- **Improvement** — library auto-paginates when source filter hides all results on a page, fetching up to 200 items per section to find matching providers.
- **Improvement** — search strategies (HA proxy + MA WebSocket) run in parallel for faster results.
- **Improvement** — search debounce increased to 700 ms to avoid firing searches while still typing.
- **Improvement** — search results render progressively per section (artists, albums, tracks, playlists).
- **Cleanup** — removed all console logging from the card (except version banner).

### 2.8.5
- **Feature** — library source filter (All / Local / Streaming) and favorites toggle.
- **Improvement** — slider UX improvements.

### 2.8.2
- **Fix** — device picker dropdown not reflecting updated exclusion list after integration options were changed. The card now re-fetches its configuration from the backend every time it reconnects to the DOM (e.g. when navigating back to the dashboard), ensuring the hidden-players list is always in sync with what is set in **Settings → Devices & Services → Configure**.

### 2.8.1
- **Fix** — stale group members no longer persist across player switches when the group was dissolved externally in HA.
- **Fix** — excluded players list pruned of deleted entity IDs on each options save.

### 2.8.0
- **Feature** — player grouping: attach and detach players directly from the device picker inside the card.
- **Feature** — group state is persisted server-side per player and reconciled with HA's actual `group_members` attribute on load.

### 2.7.0
- **Feature** — player exclusion: hide specific players from the device picker via integration options. Supports exact entity IDs and wildcard patterns (e.g. `media_player.browser_mod_*`).
- **Feature** — wildcard glob patterns for player exclusion (e.g. `media_player.prefix_*`).

### 2.6.0
- **Feature** — queue persisted server-side per player via `POST /api/my_music_library/queue`; shared across browsers and devices.
- **Feature** — auto-detection of externally triggered album/playlist changes; stale queue cleared automatically.
- **Improvement** — search falls back through three strategies (HA proxy → Music Assistant WebSocket → browse_media) for maximum compatibility.

### 2.5.0
- **Feature** — custom tab-bar buttons (`nav_buttons_left` / `nav_buttons_right`) with tap, hold and double-tap actions.
- **Feature** — `height` card config option to set a fixed card height.
- **Feature** — `entity` card config option to pre-select a default player.

### 2.4.0
- **Feature** — Library tab: browse favorite artists, albums, playlists and tracks.
- **Feature** — infinite scroll / pagination for large libraries.

### 2.3.0
- **Feature** — Search tab: full-text search across artists, albums, tracks and playlists.

### 2.2.0
- **Feature** — multilingual support: English, French, German.
- **Feature** — responsive layout (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on tablet/desktop).

### 2.1.0
- **Feature** — device picker: switch between media players at runtime; selection saved in `localStorage`.

### 2.0.0
- Initial public release: Player tab with now-playing display, playback controls, progress bar, volume and queue.
